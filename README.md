**Overview:**
Users without design expertise can create professional-looking content by simply providing text or selecting templates. AI can generate or edit images based on their inputs, removing the need for advanced graphic design skills. The software can detect and remove unwanted elements (e.g., old logos or text) and replace them with new designs or branding elements using AI inpainting.

**Efficiency for Businesses:**
- **Marketing Collateral**: Businesses can create posters, flyers, and banners for promotions without hiring graphic designers. For example:
- Input: “Promotional poster for Black Friday sale.”
- Output: A fully designed poster with attention-grabbing visuals and text generated by AI.
- **Brand Consistency**: AI can ensure that all materials align with a business’s branding guidelines, automatically applying the right colors, fonts, and styles.
- **Eliminates Need for Expensive Tools**: Instead of investing in costly design software or hiring professionals, users can leverage this tool for affordable, high-quality outputs.

**Technical Approach:**
**Overview of the tools used:**
- OpenCV (cv2): OpenCV is a powerful computer vision library used for image preprocessing (e.g., grayscale conversion, contrast enhancement, denoising, etc.).
- EasyOCR: A Python-based OCR tool that detects and extracts text from images with bounding boxes.
- Google Vision OCR: A cloud-based OCR service that provides refined text detection and bounding box coordinates.
- Pillow (PIL): A Python library for image processing and manipulation (e.g., creating masks).
- OpenAI DALL-E API: An AI model used for image generation and editing, including inpainting specific regions of an image.
- NumPy: A library for numerical computations, also used for handling image arrays.
- Google Cloud: A cloud platform with Vision API to detect text.
- OpenAI API: An API for utilizing OpenAI’s image editing and generation capabilities.
